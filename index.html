	<h1>Chris's About Me Page</h1>	
	<h3>Chris Kerrin. 26. Seattle.</h3>

	<h2 class="subject">The Beginning</h2>
	<p>I grew up in Phoenix, AZ where I spent my days playing sports, jamming tunes, and conjuring pranks.</p>
	<p>I have two brothers, both of whom live in the LA area.</p>

	<h2 class="subject">The Red & Blue</h2>
	<p>After high school, I decided to take my talents to what is widely considered as the Harvard of the Southwest: The University of Arizona</p>
	<p>Here, I ran the largest student section on the West Coast and sold preium seating for the athletic department.</p>
	<p>Because I need to write more things, I will provide a bulleted list of where I lived each of my four years of college:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>La Paz Dorms</li>
		<li>Adams & Mountain</li>
		<li>Country Club & Waverly AKA The Bird's Nest</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Prior to graduating, I secured employement with Amazon in Seattle so I got my affairs in order and prepared to move to the PNW.</p>

	<h2 class="subject">Up, Up, and Away</h2>
	<p>I moved to Seattle without knowing a soul and have since moved on from the corporate world to a digital advertising agency on Capitol Hill.</p>
	<p>I specialize in Paid Social advertising, overseeing a handful of clients and helping them achieve their marketing goals through various social media channels.</p>
	<p>My clients include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>PF Chang's</li>
		<li>Amazon Appstore</li>
		<li>eBay</li>
		<li>Outdoor Research</li>
	</ul>
